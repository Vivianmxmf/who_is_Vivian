Inspired by the film 12 Angry Men, our project simulates the complex dynamics of jury deliberation using Python and Google’s Gemini model. In this interactive experience, the user plays Juror #4 alongside five AI-generated jurors to debate the murder case of Leo Briggs, with 18-year-old Jack Miller accused. The case features conflicting evidence, multiple suspects, and deep reasonable doubt—offering rich ground for deliberation.

We implemented both a scripted mode (with fixed juror personas) and a generated mode (with dynamically created jurors) to explore replayability and realism. The AI jurors respond turn-by-turn, arguing based on facts, biases, and personas, while the human participant can speak, vote, or exit. Voting rounds drive the deliberation toward a verdict or continued debate, ending with a summary and AI-generated performance feedback.

The project investigates how effectively GenAI can model high-stakes human reasoning, revealing challenges like managing AI bias, prompt sensitivity, and lack of emotional nuance. Looking ahead, we envision adding visual evidence, lawyer roles, smarter alliances, and even an accessible platform or API for educational use.
