We study whether large language models (LLMs), used as boundedly rational agents, can reproduce the qualitative findings of a canonical status–network model without human subjects and entirely in simulation. Building a faithful simulator of Antinyan et al. (2019), we evaluate six standard regimes—low/high inequality under fixed or endogenous networks, with and without progressive tax plus equal rebate—and compare a text-driven, policy-over-actions LLM agent
against a scripted best-response (BR) baseline. Across regimes, LLM societies replicate the direction of the main comparative statics: moving from low to high inequality shifts status spending and welfare in the expected directions, while endogenous link formation attenuates these shocks via income homophily; the canonical cross-sectional pattern also holds (status spending shares fall with income, while status levels and utility rise). Relative to BR, LLM
agents spend less on the status good yet display higher dispersion in utilities; modestly finer action grids and simple BR fallbacks improve alignment without inflating conspicuous spending. A language-only “norm nudge” alters decile profiles and aggregate outcomes, illustrating policy levers that are inherently linguistic. Finally, measuring tax incidence with disposable (post–taxand- rebate) income is crucial for interpreting redistribution effects. Overall, LLM agents emerge as viable, controllable components for agent-based macro–social simulations, reproducing qualitative patterns while opening a path to language-mediated interventions.
