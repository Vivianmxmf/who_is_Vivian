abstract: Traditional interactive narrative systems offer strong authorial control and structural coherence but often restrict player agency. In contrast, LLM-driven narratives enable open-ended generation and greater flexibility, yet frequently suffer from inconsistency and diminished narrative control. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose a hybrid narrative framework that dynamically balances pre-authored content with real-time LLM generation via semantic similarity alignment. Additionally, sustaining narrative quality over extended gameplay remains a core challenge in LLM-based storytelling. To address this, we introduce a self-evolving, feedback-driven optimization framework that leverages in-context learning to iteratively refine prompts, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering. Through a case study and participant-based evaluation, we show that our framework enhances narrative coherence while preserving player agency, effectively aligning generated content with both authorial intent and evolving player behavior.
